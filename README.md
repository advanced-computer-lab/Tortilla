Project Title:

An Airline Reservation System is a web application through which individuals can
reserve and pay for flights in order to travel to different countries and sometimes
domestic cities.


Motivation:

We are developing this project to learn how to build a functional website using
MERN stack technology and developing a sufficient UI/UX.

Build Status:

Currently the project is still under development it has no bugs or errors but it
still does not have an authentication system to handle different users or
logging system and until this is done we require user email to differentiate
between users.

Code Style:

This project is developed using MERN stack so every page is component to
make it easy to track.

Tech/Framework used:

MERN stack and css . MongoDB as the database.

Features:

When reserving a flight seats you can choose your own seat by clicking on
the button that has the seat number.
