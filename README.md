Airline Ticket Reservation System.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Online airline ticketing saves time and money for the customer as well as the airline company thereby making air travel more customer-centric. This project is an attempt to simulate the basic concepts of an airline reservation system.

Our airline ticket reservation system has the following features:-

Customers can:

  Create an account
  Search for available flights for a particular city-pair
  Book tickets in the class of their choice
  Cancel booked tickets
  View booked tickets


Administrators can:

  Add/Modify flight schedules
  Viewing all the flights

This system also incorporates a frequent flier miles points system for loyal customers which will provide additional benefits to them.

This project was implemented using ReactJs for the front-end and JavaScript for the back-end. The database was created and updated using Mongodb.
